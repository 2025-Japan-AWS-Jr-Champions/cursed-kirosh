# Hackathon Judging Criteria

When developing features or documentation for this project, optimize for the three equally weighted judging criteria:

## 1. Potential Value

Prioritize solutions that are:
- Widely useful and accessible to diverse users
- Intuitive with clear UI/UX design
- Unique or differentiated from existing solutions
- Scalable and extensible for future needs

## 2. Implementation (Kiro Usage)

Demonstrate effective Kiro usage by:
- Leveraging multiple Kiro features (vibe coding, agent hooks, specs, steering, MCP)
- Showing deep understanding of each feature's benefits
- Documenting strategic decisions in feature selection and workflow integration
- Experimenting with different approaches to find optimal solutions

## 3. Quality and Design

Emphasize:
- Creative and original approaches to problem-solving
- Polished, thoughtful design choices
- Unique use of public resources (datasets, APIs, libraries)
- Delightful user experiences

## 4. Development Guidelines

- All materials must be in English
- Document Kiro usage comprehensively in `docs/submission-requirements/`
- Focus on demonstrating both breadth and depth of Kiro feature usage
- Balance innovation with practical utility

## 5. Core Requirements

### Functionality
- Must install and run consistently on the target platform
- Must function as documented and demonstrated
- Must be production-ready, not a prototype

### Kiro Feature Usage
- Must utilize Kiro features (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs)
- Document all Kiro feature usage in `docs/submission-requirements/`
- Demonstrate strategic integration of features

### Project Status
- New projects: Built entirely during the hackathon period
- Existing projects: Must show significant updates and solve a new use case
- Document what changed and why in existing projects

### Third-Party Integration
- Verify authorization for all SDKs, APIs, and data sources
- Comply with licensing requirements and terms of service
- Document integration choices and rationale

## Development Guidelines

When implementing features:
- Align all decisions with the chosen category theme
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility where applicable
- Write clear installation and usage instructions
- Test thoroughly on the target platform
- All materials must be in English
