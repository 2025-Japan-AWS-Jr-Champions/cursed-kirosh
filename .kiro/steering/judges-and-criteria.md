# Hackathon Judging Criteria

When developing features or documentation for this project, optimize for the three equally weighted judging criteria:

## 1. Potential Value

Prioritize solutions that are:
- Widely useful and accessible to diverse users
- Intuitive with clear UI/UX design
- Unique or differentiated from existing solutions
- Scalable and extensible for future needs

## 2. Implementation (Kiro Usage)

Demonstrate effective Kiro usage by:
- Leveraging multiple Kiro features (vibe coding, agent hooks, specs, steering, MCP)
- Showing deep understanding of each feature's benefits
- Documenting strategic decisions in feature selection and workflow integration
- Experimenting with different approaches to find optimal solutions

## 3. Quality and Design

Emphasize:
- Creative and original approaches to problem-solving
- Polished, thoughtful design choices
- Unique use of public resources (datasets, APIs, libraries)
- Delightful user experiences

## Development Guidelines

- All materials must be in English
- Document Kiro usage comprehensively in `docs/submission-requirements/`
- Focus on demonstrating both breadth and depth of Kiro feature usage
- Balance innovation with practical utility
